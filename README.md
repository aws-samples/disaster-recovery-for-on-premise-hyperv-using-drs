# Simulate an on-premise Hyper-V disaster recovery using AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS)

This repository contains a sample CloudFormation template to deploy an infrastructure on AWS as outlined in the blog 'Disaster Recovery for on-premise Hyper-V using Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS)'. It simulates an on-premise Hyper-V environment in AWS and creates the supporting DRS network architecture components. Once the infrastructure is set up, you can follow along with the steps described in the blog post to set up Elastic Disaster Recovery, install the replication agent, initiate a drill and perform a failback.
